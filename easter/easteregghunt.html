        <h1>Egg Race</h1>
        <p>Egg Race
            Rules:
            Competitors race either individually in the manner of a relay race. If the egg falls
            from the spoon then competitors be disqualified.
            Competitors will line up at the starting line and be given an egg and spoon. You
            may hold onto the egg until the race begins. When the race judge says get ready on
            your mark, you are to line up on the start line and, are not allowed at this time to be
            touching your eggs. When you hear GO! you run to the finish line. If the egg falls
            from the spoon then competitors be disqualified. The first 3 to cross the finish line
            with their egg still on the spoon will be the winners.
            It is generally regarded as cheating to stick the egg to the spoon with anything to
            help hold it in place or to hold on to it with one's finger.</p>
